# PIXELS &harr; DPI &harr; INCHES CALCULATOR

This is a simple calculator for determining the pixel size, dots-per-inch (DPI) resolution, or PDF print width for an image file, given two
of those values. For example, given an image width in pixels and a PDF target width in inches, you can determine the corresponding DPI setting.

For portability &mdash; keeping everything in a single file &mdash; all CSS style declarations used by this script are embedded in this file.

> I originally designed this calculator as a tool for Adobe FrameMaker users preparing documents for PDF or print; hence the references to FrameMaker.
